# ft_containers
In this project, we reimplemented some of the STL containers, defined by the ISO 1998.
Those containers are :

- vector
- stack (underlying our own vector)
- map
- set

In addition to this, reimplemented some extra features and utilities, as:

- iterator_traits
- reverse_iterator
- enable_if
- is_integral
- equal
- lexicographical_compare
- pair
- make_pair
